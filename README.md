## BlowUpPDF

This project provides a web-based tool for splitting PDF files into four equal parts. It allows users to upload a PDF, which is then processed to create a new PDF where each page is divided into quarters, displayed on the screen, and available for download.

The four quarters can then be combined, either on a project board and a wall to increase it's size and visibility. Multiple page PDFs are supported.

## Features
